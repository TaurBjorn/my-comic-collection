# my-comic-collection

I started this project to manage my increasing collection of comics. 

For this project I have implemented for the first time the concept of localstorage, which holds items into the browser.

How to use the app?

-Fill in the input fields 
-Add a your comic
-A table appears beneath with the inserted data from the user. 


Features likely to be added in the future:

-Extra input fields
-Validation logic(optional)
-Connecting the frontend with a backend

Feel free to pull the project. Extra tips and improvements are welcome.
